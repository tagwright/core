// Package runtime abstracts a container runtime (Docker or Podman) behind the
// small set of operations Ballast needs: discover containers and their mounts,
// watch the socket for lifecycle changes, exec into a container to quiesce or
// dump it, and stop or start it for a cold backup.
//
// The interface is deliberately kept free of any tool-specific type. It was
// shaped against exactly one real consumer (Ballast) before being lifted into
// github.com/tagwright/core, which is the discipline that keeps the abstraction
// honest.
//
// The Docker adapter lands first. The Podman adapter follows behind the
// same interface, talking to Podman's Docker-compatible compat API and
// absorbing the socket-path and compose-label differences.
